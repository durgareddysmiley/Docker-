DOCKER
Docker is a containerization platform that enables applications to run in isolated containers that share the host OS, making them fast, lightweight, and portable.

SIMPLY TO UNDERSTAND == Instead of creating a new Virtual Machine every time, we create ONE Docker environment, and inside it we create many containers. This takes less time and fewer resources.

2️⃣ WHY DOCKER WAS INTRODUCED? (Very important)

Docker was introduced to solve Virtual Machine problems.

PROBLEMS WITH VMS:

Heavy (full OS every time)

Slow startup

High memory & CPU usage

Difficult to scale

Docker Solution:

Shares host OS

Very fast startup

Less resource usage

Easy scaling

3️⃣ Virtual Machine vs Docker (Interview table)
Feature	       Virtual Machine	      Docker
OS	              Own OS             Shares host OS
Size	             GBs	                  MBs
Startup	         Minutes	             Seconds
Performance	     Slower	                Faster
Resource usage	 High	                   Low
Isolation	       Strong	                Light
Portability	     Limited	                High

7️⃣ MUST-REMEMBER DOCKER COMMANDS (INTERVIEW CORE)

🔹 CHECK DOCKER

docker --version


🔹 PULL IMAGE

docker pull nginx -- It just shows the image and didnt run anything 


🔹 LIST IMAGES

docker images


🔹 RUN CONTAINER (MOST IMPORTANT)

docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx


🔹 LIST CONTAINERS

docker ps
docker ps -a


🔹 STOP CONTAINER

docker stop <container_id>


🔹 REMOVE CONTAINER

docker rm <container_id>


🔹 REMOVE IMAGE

docker rmi <image_id>


🔹 BUILD IMAGE

docker build -t myapp .


🔹 EXECUTE INSIDE CONTAINER

docker exec -it <container_id> bash

8️⃣ TOP 5 COMMANDS (MEMORIZE ONLY THESE IF TIME IS LOW)
docker pull
docker run
docker ps
docker stop
docker build
