🟦 TOP 15 DOCKER INTERVIEW QUESTIONS + PERFECT ANSWERS

1. WHAT IS DOCKER AND WHY DID YOU USE IT IN YOUR PROJECT?

Answer:
Docker is a tool that lets you package your application along with its dependencies, system tools, and environment configuration into a lightweight container.
I used Docker so my Python application runs the same everywhere — on my laptop, on a server, or in the cloud — without installing Python, cron, or libraries manually.

2. WHAT IS A DOCKERFILE?

Answer:
A Dockerfile is a script that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image.
It defines:

Which base image to use

What dependencies to install

What files to copy

What commands to run

I wrote a Dockerfile with a multi-stage build, installed cron, set UTC timezone, and exposed port 8080.

3. WHAT IS A DOCKER IMAGE?

Answer:
A Docker image is a read-only template created from the Dockerfile.
It contains the entire application environment.
It’s like a recipe.

4. WHAT IS A DOCKER CONTAINER?

Answer:
A container is a running instance of an image.
It behaves like a small, isolated machine that runs only my application and its dependencies.

5. WHY DID YOU USE A MULTI-STAGE DOCKER BUILD?

Answer:
To keep my final image lightweight.
In the first stage, I installed Python dependencies.
In the second stage, I copied only the necessary runtime files.
This reduces the image size and improves security and performance.

6. WHAT BASE IMAGE DID YOU USE AND WHY?

Answer:
I used python:3.11-slim because it is lightweight and production-friendly.
It reduces image size and improves startup time.

7. HOW DID YOU INSTALL OS-LEVEL DEPENDENCIES LIKE CRON?

Answer:
Inside the Dockerfile, I ran:

apt-get update
apt-get install -y cron tzdata


This installed the cron daemon and timezone tools inside the container.

8. HOW DID YOU SET THE TIMEZONE TO UTC INSIDE DOCKER?

Answer:
I set:

ENV TZ=UTC
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime
echo "UTC" > /etc/timezone


This ensures all logs and cron jobs run in consistent UTC time.

9. HOW DID YOU SCHEDULE CRON JOBS INSIDE THE CONTAINER?

Answer:
I copied a cron file into the container:

COPY cron/my-cron-job .
RUN chmod 0644 my-cron-job && crontab my-cron-job


Then I started cron with:

CMD cron && python api_server.py

10. WHY DID YOU EXPOSE PORT 8080?

Answer:
My Python API server runs on port 8080 inside the container.
To allow external access, I used:

EXPOSE 8080


And while running:

docker run -p 8080:8080 my-app

11. WHAT ARE DOCKER VOLUMES, AND WHY DID YOU CREATE /DATA AND /CRON?

Answer:
Volumes store data outside the container so it isn't deleted when the container stops.
I created volumes:

VOLUME ["/data", "/cron"]


These store:

/data → application data

/cron → logs or backup files created by cron

12. HOW DO YOU BUILD A DOCKER IMAGE?

Answer:
In VS Code terminal:

docker build -t my-app .

13. HOW DO YOU RUN YOUR CONTAINER?

Answer:

docker run -p 8080:8080 -v data-vol:/data -v cron-vol:/cron my-app

14. WHAT PROBLEM DOES DOCKER SOLVE FOR YOUR PROJECT?

Answer:
Docker solved:

“works on my machine” issues

dependency conflicts

environment setup problems

deployment complexity

It gave me a consistent, repeatable environment.

15. WHAT CHALLENGES DID YOU FACE WHILE CREATING THE DOCKERFILE?

Answer:
Challenges:

Running cron inside the container

Setting timezone correctly

Copying Python dependencies from the builder stage

Keeping final image small

Starting both cron + API server together

I solved these using multi-stage builds, environment variables, and CMD commands.
